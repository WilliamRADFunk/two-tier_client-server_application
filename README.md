# Two-tier Client-Server Java Application
Small Java application (GUI) demonstrating connectivity to a MySQL database.<br/><br/>

This project's purpose will be to practice basic Java skills, create and implement an FXML graphical interface, connect with a MySQL database, and allow a user to manipulate that database through the GUI.<br/><br/>

User enters has the ability to change the JDBC Driver through a dropdown, and the Database URL as well.<br/><br/>

The Username and Password will provide the login materials needed to determine what authority user has over database queries.<br/><br/>

There is an area for the user to type in their SQL commands, but it will be the "Execute SQL Command" button that implements it. A "Clear Command" button wipes the area clean to start again.<br/><br/>

A "Connect to Database" button uses the user-supplied data to connect to the database, while inverse "Disconnect from Database" severs the connection.<br/><br/>

Once the query is executed and determined to be valid, the database results will be supplied in the SQL Execution Result section at the bottom of the GUI.<br/><br/>

This program uses FXML, Scene Builder 2.0, MySQL 5.7, and implements a basic GUI for the user.<br/><br/>

Screenshots were uploaded to demonstrate the program in its working form.
